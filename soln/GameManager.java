/**
 *
 * GameManager objects allow the user to start, load, save and play game(s). In the main method, interaction with the game user is via the console.
 *
 * You need to provide a main method where the first command line parameter can optionally specify a saved game to load ({@link #loadGame loadGame()}) and play ({@link #playGame playGame()}).
 *
 * If a game is not underway the user may start a new game by entering 'NEW _player1type_ _player2type_' where the player types are either 'Human' or 'Computer'. The user may optionally specify player names with a colon but no space. E.g. 'NEW Human:Steven Computer:Orac' will start a new game between a human player called 'Steven' and a computer player called 'Orac'.
 *
 * If a game is not underway the user may load a previously saved game by entering 'LOAD _fname_' where _fname_ is the name of a previously saved game file ({@link #loadGame loadGame()}). The game is then restarted ({@link #playGame playGame()}).
 *
 * If a game is not underway but a game has been set up through LOAD or NEW or command line parameter then the game can be saved with 'SAVE _fname_'.
 *
 * If a game is not underway (e.g. because the game has finished) then the command 'EXIT' halts the program.
 
 * The GameManager also implements Comparator on Player by playing two games, with the two players taking turns to start. If the two games yield symmetric results (e.g. player 1 wins, player 2 wins) the the players are considered equal, otherwise the better player is better ...
 *
 * You need to provide a default constructor (no parameters) for a GameManager.
