/**
 *
 * Board objects represent the state of the Oware board, including the number of seeds in each of the houses
 * and in the two score houses, where captured seeds are placed. Players are numbered 1 and 2 and each player has houses numbered 1..6.
 *
 * Board objects are updatable by accepting moves.
 *
 * Board objects are constructed either from nothing (default constructor), or by cloning. Cloning is needed during game play to ensure that players are not able to update the game board directly.
 *
 * See <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oware'>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oware</a> for the layout and rules of Oware. These are summarised in <a href='//community.dur.ac.uk/s.p.bradley/teaching/IP/assignment_oware/'>community.dur.ac.uk/s.p.bradley/teaching/IP/assignment_oware/</a>/
