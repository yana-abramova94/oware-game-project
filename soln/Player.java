/**
 * Player objects represent players in the game: they select their move based on the Board they are given and which side of the board they are playing. They may quit the game before a result is decided. Results are decided by the {@link Game}.
 *
 * You need to provide two implementations of this interface, one called HumanPlayer, which acts under control of the user, and one called ComputerPlayer which plays automatically and as well as it can within the time constraints.
 *
 * Input from the human players and output to the players can be redirected with in and out. Your Player should always use in and out for input and output rather than System.in and System.out.
 * 
 * A default contructor with no parameters is required for each imeplementation of the interface. By default the input should be set to System.in and the output stream to System.out
